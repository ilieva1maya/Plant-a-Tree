# Plant-a-Tree

Welcome to my first student's project in React!

This is a site for planting trees. Each user can plant (create) a tree and reflect it's growing progres and needs (edit/delete).

These are the covered functionalities:
* client – server architecture
* collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations
* communication via REST
* implemented authentication
* implemented client-side routing
* error handling and data validation

I was not using consistent approaches through the project, for instance:
* controlled and uncontrolled forms
* main CSS and separate CSS files for some of the components
* validation using external library and basic validation, written by me
* error handling via try…catch and .then().catch()
This was with the purposes of my own learning curve, to try different approaches and learn more.
